# Crypto Miner Simulator
Don't just mine crypto, be the miner.


## Dependencies
Tested on python 3.6.4
`opencv-python==3.3.0.10`
`numpy==1.12.1`

## Running it
Any equivalent of `python3 game.py`
The [gifextract](https://gist.github.com/BigglesZX/4016539) tool can be used to extract sprites.

## Inspiration

Computers are pretty great these days, they can do a lot of things and fast. But I feel like sometimes we might be taking that for granted. We can't exactly communicate with machines yet and so the only real way to emphasize with them would be to put ourselves in their place.

## What it does
You are a crypto miner and you mine by making the mining motion IRL. You must put your back into it too.

## How I built it
Various OpenCV filtering and denoising techniques.
